PLAN:

* First implement a TM_EulerLagrange, which enforces the EL equations on all objects flagged 'dynamic'. First without any contacts

* Every object has a list of contacts; allow to specify the contact schedule explicitly as part of a skeleton.

* Show a ball bouncing; show a block bouncing?

FROM SCRATCH:

* directly in KOMO:
1) Have a list of dynamic bodies!
2) Have a list of contacts! Each with a elastic parameter \in [0,1]
3) Each contact has a force/impulse scalar DOF!
-> zero tangential velocity (max friction!)
-> impulse thing

* demo: bounce ball 3-times until it hits green patch: The initial state is free!!
